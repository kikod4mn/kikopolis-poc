# Kikopolis MVC Framework

### An MVC pattern framework with custom templating engine, orm, and basically everything albeit much of it is based in the examples of my lessons from other frameworks and tutorials.

#

This is a learning project for me and there are lots of @todo's in the back of my mind. Currently not much is functional.
Here is the list of current most important functionality.

-   Composer autoloading
-   Ioc container - a simple container that injects dependencies
-   Router - accepts dynamic routes aswell as static ones. Also several helpful functions to add a multitude of different routes and process them. Much work yet to do.
-   Basics of an App kernel are there. Again, lots and lots of @todo's...

Thats it! It's basic and in no way, shape or form is it either production ready and it might not be that ready for a long long while.
But what better way to learn some important concepts in programming than to bite off a way bigger chuck than a beginner can chew? sign...
